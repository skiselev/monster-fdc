# Monster Floppy Disk Controller (Monster FDC)
ISA floppy disk controller card that supports up to 8 floppy drives

## Introduction
Monster FDC is an ISA floppy disk controller card that features two FDCs. Each FDC supports up to four floppy drives. IRQ and DMA channel are configurable for the secondary FDC, and they are hardwired to IRQ6 and DMA2 for the primary FDC. The card also includes a serial port (UART) with configurable I/O address and IRQ.
